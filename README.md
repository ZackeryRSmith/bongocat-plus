> [!NOTE]
the state of the refactor is not current with the in-dev branch... *so then why is this (refactor) the default?*

> Simply because I believe it's more indicative of this projects direction. If you want a version of Bongocat-Plus
that's fully complete. Please check out [in-dev](https://github.com/ZackeryRSmith/bongocat-plus/tree/in-dev)

# About the Project
A Bongo Cat overlay with ~~smooth paw movement~~ **(**[#27](https://github.com/ZackeryRSmith/bongocat-plus/issues/27)**)** and a highly customizable script, written in C++. *This project is an improved fork* as the original project has lost support from the developers (80+ unsolved issues). This project once aimed just to implement nearly all the feature requests. It has since broken off, becoming unrecognisable from the original. All the code from the original has been rewritten, but it's all thanks to the wonderful people who created Bongocat-Osu, that Bongocat-Plus exists!

# Compiling
To compile bongocat-plus you need to install some dependencies:

- **Git** *(this is an optional dependancy)*
- **GCC**, **G++**, *any c/c++ compiler really*
- **Make**
- **CMake** >=3.10 *(may be lowered soon, see [#55](https://github.com/ZackeryRSmith/bongocat-plus/issues/55))*
- **SFML** >=2.5 *(not required on Windows, see [#28](https://github.com/ZackeryRSmith/bongocat-plus/issues/28))*
- **Lua** >=5.4 *(this is an optional dependancy, see [#51](https://github.com/ZackeryRSmith/bongocat-plus/issues/51))*

*Now, that's out of the way*. We can now actually compile Bongocat-Plus

1. First clone the repository, (assuming you have Git) thats as simple as `git clone https://github.com/ZackeryRSmith/bongocat-plus`
2. Jump into the repo with a `cd bongocat-plus`
3. Then to generate the make files run `cmake .`
4. Top it off by running `make`
